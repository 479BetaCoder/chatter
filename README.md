Developed a Twitter clone where user can tweet and see the recent tweet from all the users. Added the news API where the user can scroll through the recent trending news around the world. The tweet created by the user includes the avatar, username, date and the content. Adding the ability for the other users to like and comment tweets. User can scroll through the list of comments on the tweet and can reply back. If user tried to enter any of the abusive words, the user will not be able to post the tweet. All the tweets are store to the backend database, which will help the user find their past tweets.
